# Movie Studio Profitability Analysis
### Introduction
As our company considers entering the film production industry, it's critical to understand what types of movies generate strong returns. Certain genres, release strategies, and creative talent demonstrate consistent profitability, while others present significant financial risks.

This analysis uses historical movie data to identify patterns in successful films across genres, budgets, release timing, and director performance. The goal is to inform production decisions with evidence-based insights, minimizing financial risk for our new studio.

## 3. Data Preparation

### Cleaning Process
1. **Currency Conversion**:
   ```python
   # Convert $110,000,000 â†’ 110000000
   for col in ['production_budget', 'domestic_gross', 'worldwide_gross']:
       df_budget[col] = df_budget[col].str.replace('$', '').str.replace(',', '').astype(int)
   ```

2. **Date Handling**:
   ```python
   df_budget['release_date'] = pd.to_datetime(df_budget['release_date'], format='%b %d, %Y')
   ```

3. **Genre Extraction**:
   ```python
   movies['main_genre'] = movies['genres'].str.split(',').str[0]
   ```

### Merging Strategy
```mermaid
    A[TheNumbers] -->|Title + Year| C[Merged Data]
    B[IMDB] -->|Title + Year| C
    C -->|Movie ID| D[+ Directors]
```

### Feature Engineering
```python
# Profit calculations
movie_df['profit'] = movie_df['worldwide_gross'] - movie_df['production_budget']
movie_df['roi'] = (movie_df['profit'] / movie_df['production_budget']) * 100

# Release month
movie_df['release_month'] = movie_df['release_date'].dt.month_name()

# Budget categories
movie_df['budget_category'] = pd.cut(
    movie_df['production_budget'],
    bins=[0, 10e6, 50e6, float('inf')],
    labels=['low', 'medium', 'high']
)
```
